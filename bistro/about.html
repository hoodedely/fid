        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2015, Hope Haven Animal Rescue began as a grassroots effort by a group of passionate animal lovers in our community. Since then, we've grown into a thriving organization, rehoming over 1,200 pets and spreading awareness about animal welfare.</p>

        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>We focus on rescuing animals from shelters, abusive situations, and the streets. Each animal receives medical care, vaccinations, and a thorough behavior evaluation before being placed for adoption.</p>
    
        <h3>Meet Our Team</h3>
        <p>Our team includes dedicated staff and volunteers — from foster parents to event planners — who give their time and love to our mission. Together, we’re making a difference.</p>
